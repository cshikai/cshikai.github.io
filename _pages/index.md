I build machine learning systems and data products.

I am an Applied Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer. 

Most of my work is hands-on.

I build ML systems for search, recommender systems, and entity resolution to support software products. Previously, I was a defence scientist in Singapore, specializing in information retrieval, and a research assistant and graduate student at the MIT Media Lab’s Human Dynamics group. My academic work focused on extracting macro-level social and economic insights from large-scale behavioral data, with publications in EPJ Data Science and Entropy.

On this site, i achieve my learnings and cool projects that i have worked on, feel free to browse and reach out to me!
